# Data-Mining
Data mining project applying machine learning techniques on real-world data.

-Classification of Mobile Phone Price Dataset-
This project was developed as part of a Data Mining course and focuses on classifying mobile phones into price categories using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict the price range of a mobile device based on its features.

-Dataset-
Name: Mobile Phone Price Dataset
Features: Includes technical attributes like battery power, RAM, screen resolution, etc.

-Algorithms Used-
The following supervised learning algorithms were applied:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree

Each model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.

-Results-
All models showed varying degrees of success in classifying the phones. The results highlight the differences in how each algorithm handles the dataset and which one performs best for this classification task.

-Technologies Used-
Python
Google Colaboratory
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Key Learnings-
How to clean and preprocess real-world datasets
How to apply and compare multiple classification algorithms
How to evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recal and f1-score
The importance of selecting appropriate algorithms for specific tasks
